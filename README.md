1.) **Calculator_v1-terminal**
Basic Calculator using basic arithmetic and basic function calls and modules

2.) **Calculator_v2-terminal**
It's a command-line calculator with basic modules, functions and dictionary for equations
I also used try except to catch simple ValueError and while loop to make the app running until the user selects 'quit' to exit

3.) **GUI-Calculator_v3-tkinter**
Basic Calculator using tkinter applying functions, eval() and label/button widgets. using lambda for function calls.

4.) **To-do List (Terminal)**
This to-do list includes file handling and writing to .txt file. Load task, add task, delete and edit task.
I tried using Dictionary to map the choices of user input for task management and also used "try - except" to practice my exception handling, where I put mostly on user inputs.
There are 2 versions inside this folder project, the only difference is that I separated the functions into a module on the other one.

You need to have python installed to run the app.
You may download it from python.org
