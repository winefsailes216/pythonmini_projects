1.) Calculator_v1
Basic Calculator using basic function calls and modules

2.) Calculator_v2
It's a command-line calculator with basic modules, functions and dictionary for equations
I also used try except to catch simple ValueError and while loop to make the app running until the user selects 'quit' to exit

You need to have python installed to run the app.
Get it from python.org
